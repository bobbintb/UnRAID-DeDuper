# This file specifies all the files used in your plugin. At a minimum, you will want to include your plugin package like below.
# The file will be downloaded from the given URL and saved to where the `Name` field specifies. The `Run` field specifies the
# command that will be ran in the command line for this package. The MD5 is a variable that is defined in the ENTITIES section
# of the plugin file. For the source package, this creator automatically handles that since it changes with every plugin release.
# You can include an MD5 for other files as well. Hard coding the MD5 hash is fine for files that don't change.

# You may also want to include a default config file such as the one below. The `Mode` specifies the permissions. This does not
# download a file like the previous example but instead creates one from the text between the `CDATA` tags. There is no `Run`
# because this file is only created. There is nothing to extract or run.

# You could however, create a bash script and run it. Essentially, including the `Name` field saves the file to the specified location.
